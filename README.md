BOOKSHOP SYSTEM

This project showcases the implementation of a Bookshop System using Java, JPA (Java Persistence API) and Spring Data with a focus on database design, data seeding, and query writing. The system involves three main entities: Book, Author, and Category, and includes functionalities such as seeding data into the database, writing specific queries, and later expanding the system with a User Management module.
